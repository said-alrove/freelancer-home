# [freelancer-home](https://freelancer-home-392892.netlify.app/)
This is the third project from Juan Pablo's course of [CSS Grid and Flexbox](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-grid-y-flexbox-la-guia-definitiva-crea-10-proyectos/).

> **Note:** Recently I've started to deploy my sites on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/), therefore I changed the domain's link to the new one (in the HTML and the README files), but I kept the screenshots that held the old domain (there's no reason for changing it, the result would've been the same with a different link only).

> **Disclaimer:** I'm starting to learn how to use **Git/Github** correctly, therefore there'll be plenty of pull requests, commits and other stuff as tests in this repository, however, *this won't represent my way of working forever*, I'll learn more things along the way as always :D!.
